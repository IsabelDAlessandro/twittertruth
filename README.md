The data folder contains 3 subfolders: 
1) Sentiment Data
This folder contains the data used for the sentiment classifier.

2) Skepticism Data
This folder contains the data from SemEval that was used for the skepticism classifier. This contains the data generated from cross validation as well as the JSON file created using the actual SemEval data (not included in this drive).

3) Takis Data
This folder contains the test data that we are looking at. These are the tweets from Twitter Trails that Takis provided us with. This folder contains the whole data set as well as when it is split into training, development, amd testing.
